//  Operator Overloading: 
//  C++ also provides options to overload operators. For example, we can make the operator (‘+’) for the string class to concatenate two strings. We know that this is the addition operator whose task is to add two operands. A single operator, ‘+,’ when placed between integer operands, adds them and concatenates them when placed between string operands.

//  Points to remember: while overloading an operator:
//   ● It can be used only for user-defined operators(objects, structures) but cannot be used for in-built operators(int, char, float, etc.).
//   ● Operators = and & are already overloaded in C++, so we can avoid overloading them. ● Precedence and associativity of operators remain intact.
//   ● List of operators that cannot be overloaded in C++:
//      ::,?:,
